can't have a network effect -> has to be focused on the individual, not interactions
can't require a server -> has to be client-side only
should be useful in everyday life

-> productivity, organization



write down projects for the day
estimate the time it'll take to complete them (+ add buffer times)
estimate at what time you'll stop working - show remaining time and stats compared to time needed for tasks
make a mockup schedule for when you'll do each of them
pick which one you're currently working on, then either confirm it as finished or as half-done
display which things are done which are still to be done



name ideas:
words: Time, Productivity, Manage
Productime (taken by a dev, no company)
Productiming (hard to read at first)
Productivize
Mind Your Time (small extension)


UI (functionality):
2 states: planning or working
	- buttons - top left corner to go to planning mode, top right corner to go to working mode
	- planning by default if no projects, else working by default

planning - write down projects: name, pick color (category, picking popup, remember favorites), estimated time
	- write down the time when you wanna stop working
	- plan when to do each of them: drag and drop projects into time slots? or type time and sort (easier, less user-friendly)

working - show the schedule, current time and remaining time stats (include buffer times?)
	- pick what you're currently working on
	- if you want to stop working on something, either mark it as done (turns green) or as half-done (yellow)
	- sort intelligently, show what still has to be done


settings:
	time format (12 or 24h)???
	switch mode with tab key
	default color
	buffer times - yes or no & percentage
	rounding?
	default end time - for weekdays and weekends (Fridays and Sundays?)


UI:
/2 mode switch buttons on the sides
table with tasks - edit colors
	planning: click button on the right to edit (or simply click the text to edit it)
		drag n drop to change order
			automatically set the time for the first one (10mins or so from assignment)
			set the beginning of each next project shortly after the end of the previous one
		delete projects - icon,
			drag and drop -> show trash bin (animation), delete on drop onto the trash bin
	working: change status (mark as done, working on or partially done) - buttons: start, pause, done
		update the time of future projects according to current time? (or show if late - in red?)
		show status (color, maybe have a part of the table for finished projects)
for planning: row at the bottom of the table for adding a new project
	end time input
for working: show when to end + time stats
	show completion phase of projects



PROBLEMS:
needs a custom URL



NEW FEATURES:
store the productivity percentage of the last few days, calculate an average and tell the user if their day was above or below average
drag n drop rows in the breaks table (for organization purposes)
find a way to let the user split a project or sth like that (if 1/2 is done)
prompt the user to A2HS
plannedTime validation - make sure it doesn't collide with other projects
show errors (from TimeCalc)
handle a project taking longer than expected (adjust duration?)
Settings - make the sections collapsible
small-screen optimization
	- get rid of the duration estimate column (figure out how to show progress)
	- when editing or creating a project, show a new view instead of editing inside of the table
	- sidebar (Drawer, could also be BottomNavigation) - Plan, Work, Settings, About
	- TimeStats on top of the screen
	- footer in the About section
	- time picker - material-ui-pickers
repetitive tasks - remember and suggest (how to suggest - placeholder?)
	- first let the user input them manually, then try to suggest intelligently
Google Analytics
AdSense
tour for first-time visitors
dark theme - needs CSSBaseline and icon color change etc.
make breaks appear in the table, make em draggable


?
try to delete breaks automatically
add an animation to the congrats message - confetti
new button in planning - recalculate (replan) project times
	- startTime = currentTime - totalDoneTime
	- would only show up when needed (somehow calculate if the plan isn't going well and everything is delayed)
?


hosting: js.org
later make a React Native app (?)
sync the data  - Node server (mLab + Heroku)/AWS (login with Google)/remoteStorage
